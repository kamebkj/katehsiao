        After focusing on product design for some time, I find my passion in
        design systems and building tools to empower designers and engineers to
        do their best work. It is not too different from building a product that
        helps a specific persona to accomplish their goal, but with system
        design, I get to build the muscle of thinking more horizontally and
        finding patterns in the problem space.
        <br />
        <br />I love surrounding myself with a group of people who are
        passionate about design systems and having constant debates about the
        right altitude to focus on: from setting the vision to pushing pixels,
        from creating components to creating the process to empowering others.
        There are challenges at all stages and that is what makes system design
        fun. <br />

        Crossing these days.
